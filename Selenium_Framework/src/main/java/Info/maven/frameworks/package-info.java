maven, gradle, ant etc are build management tool
maven-pom.xml, you get when you integrate maven with eclipse
ant-build.xml, you need to create this file
if any issue arises with respect to maven project(already created project)
select project press "alt+f5" force to add dependencies
unlike normal java projects you dont need to add jars ,just paste dependencies from net
it will automatically download relevant/required dependencies which makes whole task easier
maven
=====
It helps to build projects, dependency, and documentation. Its development process is very simil
ar to ANT.However, it is much advanced than ANT. Maven is also able to build any number of projects
into desired output such as jar, war, metadata.
Maven helps the developer to create a java-based project more easily. Accessibility of new feature
created or added in Maven can be easily added to a project in Maven configuration. It increases 
the performance of project and building process. The main feature of Maven is that it can down
load the project dependency libraries automatically.

Processes which can manage using maven:
Builds
Documentation
Reporting
Dependencies
SCMs
Releases
Distribution
mailing list

How to use Maven
To configure the Maven, you need to use Project Object Model, which is stored in a pom.xml-file.
POM includes all the configuration setting related to Maven. Plugins can be configured and edit 
in the <plugins> tag of a pom.xml file. And developer can use any plugin without much detail of 
each plugin.When user start working on Maven, it provides default setting of configuration, so 
the user does not need to add every configuration in pom.xml

Steps/process involved in building the project:
Add / Write the code for application creation and process that into source code repository
Edit configuration / pom.XML / plugin details
Build the application
Save the build process output as WAR or EAR file to a local location or server
Get the file from local location or server and deploy the file to the production site or
client site Updated the application document with date and updated version number of the application
create and generate a report as per the application or requirement.

In a very simple language, we can say that a framework is a constructive blend of various guidelines,
coding standards, concepts, processes, practices, project hierarchies, modularity, reporting mecha
nism, test data injections etc. to pillar automation testing. Thus, the user can follow these guid
elines while automating application to take advantages of various productive results.

Selenium Framework is a code structure that helps to make code maintenance easy. Without frameworks,
we will place the “code” as well as “data” in the same place which is neither re-usable nor read
able. Using Frameworks, produce beneficial outcomes like increased code re-usage, higher portabil
ity, reduced script maintenance cost, higher code readability, etc.
There are mainly 3 type of frameworks created by Selenium WebDriver to automate manual test cases
Data Driven Test Framework
Keyword Driven Test Framework
Hybrid Test Framework
