/*
Hybrid Test framework is a concept where we are using the advantage of both Keyword and Data 
driven framework. Here for keywords, we will use Excel files to maintain test cases, and for test
data, we can use data, provider of Testng framework.

It can be combination of either data driven framework + modular driven framework or data driven + 
keyword driven framework
In case of ddf+mdf(hybrid) we test the modular driven with multiple set of data reading from excel
file or using data provider
Similarly in case of kdf+ddf(hybrid) we use keyword driven with multiple set of data reading from
excel file
Its upto tester to maintain data in 2 excel files or 2 sheets of same excel file
